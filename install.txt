# icinga2

We'll be using the icinga2's client certificate and common name for authentication
instead of basic auth.

Therefore edit the ApiUser class and set the client_cn to NodeName.

vim /usr/local/icinga2/etc/icinga2/conf.d/api-users.conf

object ApiUser "root" {
  password = "icinga"
  client_cn = NodeName
}
